# QA Testing Rules and Checklist for Websites

## 1. Functional Testing

**Goal:** Verify every feature works as expected.

**Rules:**

* Test all buttons, links, and navigation (no broken links, correct redirects).
* Check all forms (validation, error messages, success messages).
* Test CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) if applicable.
* Confirm dynamic content (AJAX requests, API calls) loads properly.
* Verify uploads and downloads (file size limits, formats).
* Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
* Test across different devices and screen sizes.

## 2. UI/UX Testing

**Goal:** Ensure design, layout, and interaction are consistent and intuitive.

**Rules:**

* Check alignment, spacing, colors, and typography match design specs.
* Verify responsive design on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* Test hover states, animations, and transitions.
* Validate overall user flow (registration, login, dashboard, logout, etc.).
* Confirm readability and accessibility (contrast ratio, ARIA labels, alt text).

## 3. Security Testing

**Goal:** Identify vulnerabilities that could expose data or compromise system integrity.

**Rules:**

* Test for SQL Injection using malicious input.
* Test for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting scripts in input fields.
* Verify authentication and session management (token expiration, logout).
* Ensure passwords are stored securely (hashed and salted).
* Test access control (prevent unauthorized access to restricted areas).
* Confirm HTTPS enforcement and secure cookie settings (Secure, HttpOnly).
* Check for proper use of security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).
* Use automated vulnerability scanners such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite.

## 4. Performance Testing

**Goal:** Ensure the website loads quickly and performs well under load.

**Rules:**

* Measure page load times (aim for under 3 seconds).
* Test with tools like Google Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights.
* Perform load and stress testing using JMeter or k6.
* Check API response times.
* Monitor memory usage, CPU load, and backend resource utilization.

---

## 5. Database and API Testing

**Goal:** Ensure backend logic and data integrity are correct.

**Rules:**

* Test all API endpoints for correct responses and status codes.
* Validate database constraints (unique keys, foreign keys).
* Check data persistence after operations (insert, update, delete).
* Test rate limits and throttling on APIs.
* Ensure proper error handling and logging are implemented.

---

## 6. Regression and Automation Testing

**Goal:** Ensure that new changes do not break existing features.

**Rules:**

* Maintain automated test scripts using tools like Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium.
* Run regression tests before each deployment.
* Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
* Track bugs and fixes using an issue tracker (Jira, Trello, Linear).

---

## 7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Goal:** Validate the system from the end user’s perspective.

**Rules:**

* Prepare real-world test cases and expected outcomes.
* Involve stakeholders or actual users for testing.
* Verify that business logic meets requirements.
* Record usability issues and user feedback for improvement.

---

## 8. Documentation and Reporting

**Goal:** Maintain a clear record of test coverage and issues.

**Rules:**

* Document all test cases, test data, and expected results.
* Record defects with detailed reproduction steps and screenshots.
* Prioritize issues by severity and impact.
* Summarize testing outcomes in a structured QA report.
